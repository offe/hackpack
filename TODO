- Parse command line:

hackpack.py open/unpack xyz.hp

hackpack.py unlock xyz.reward 'command line'

hackpack.py build xyz.hp [directory]
 (directory defaults to xyz (same as hp-file name) if not given)

First version simply prints the interesting parameters in reasonably named functions reflecting the three modes. 

- Build xyz.reward-file
Input: xyz.rewardclear and .out

- Implement unlock command
Manually create challenge directory, with correct xyz.reward-file. 
Output is either:
Attempt failed. Output is incorrect. 
or
Congratulation, challenge solved. 
Reward message:

Blabla

- Implement open command
In first edition simply unzips the file contents

- Implement build command
Creates .reward-files. 
Zips all files except for .out-files. 

- Add time limits
Time limits are never hard (technically enforced), only signals that notifies that it is considered cheating. 

- Generalize reward-concept
A reward should be able to contain any number of files. 
All rewards are maybe actually zip-files? 
The build command might always use xyz.rewarddir to figure out what should be in the reward. 
.hp-files in rewards should be automatically unpacked.
