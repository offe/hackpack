- Generalize reward-concept
A reward should be able to contain any number of files. 
All rewards are maybe actually zip-files? 
The build command might always use xyz.rewarddir to figure out what should be in the reward. 
.hp-files in rewards should NOT be automatically unpacked. 

- Feed in-files line by line to enable progress bar when unlocking

- Add hints

- Add time limits
Time limits are never hard (technically enforced), only signals that notifies that it is considered cheating. 


- Add support for binary input/output
