Your objective is to unlock the challenge.reward file. 

This is done by writing a program that performs a task. 

Figure out the pattern in the example.in and example.expected.
Then write a program that when fed example.in to stdin will 
produce example.expected on stdout. You can write the program 
in the language of your choice. 

When you have a program you think solves the general problem 
you can try to unlock the reward file:

$ hackpack.py challenge.reward 'my_program'

This will feed your program with challenge.in. Only if your 
program produces the correct output will the rewardfile 
be unlocked. Inside it is a message. 

Good luck!
